servings: 24

ingredients:
    - 
      name: gluten-free measure-for-measure flour
      nutritionId: 652a76a618925800087206cf
      servings: 5.3
    - 1/4 cup (25g) almond flour
    - 1 teaspoon baking soda
    - 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
    - 1/2 cup (113g) butter
    - 1 tablespoon milk of choice
    - 3/4 cup (160g) brown sugar
    - 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
    - 1 large egg
    - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    - 1 cup (170g) chocolate chips
    - sea salt for sprinkling optional

directions:
    - In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, almond flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
    - Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally.
    - Once the butter is melted and begins to foam, stir continuously to prevent the milk solids from sticking to the skillet. The butter will change from yellow to golden brown quickly and will have a nutty aroma. Remove from the heat and immediately pour into a medium bowl.
    - Add the milk, brown sugar and granulated sugar to the brown butter. Whisk to combine.
    - Whisk in the egg and vanilla until smooth and creamy.
    - Using a rubber spatula, mix in the dry ingredients until well-combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
    - Cover the bowl and let the dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 5 days.
    - Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
    - Scoop the cookie dough into round balls, about 2 tablespoons per ball. Place on the prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.
    - Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set.
    - Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with flaky salt, if desired. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Why Brown the Butter?

We brown the butter to add a rich, nutty flavor that takes these cookies to the next level. The butter will change from yellow to golden brown quickly and develop a delicious aroma.

## Why Let the Dough Rest?

After you mix the dough together it's important to give it at least a 30-minute rest. This gives the gluten-free flour time to hydrate and the flavors a chance to develop. It also helps guarantee non-gritty cookies.

If you have more time, I recommend refrigerating the dough for an even better flavor. The dough will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. The longer the dough sits the better the flavor will be!

Luckily just a room temperature 30-minute rest will do and no overnight-in-the-fridge chill is needed. So you can still have chocolate chip cookies shortly after a craving strikes!

## Recipe Notes

**Gluten-Free Flour:** Be sure to use a gluten-free flour blend that contains xanthan gum. King Arthur Flour Measure-for-Measure Flour works well. Other 1:1 gluten-free flours that contain xanthan gum such as Bob's Red Mill 1:1 Baking Flour will also work.

**Dairy-Free:** Skip steps 2-3 and simply use melted dairy-free butter (note that dairy-free butter will not brown). Omit the milk. Use dairy-free chocolate chips.

**Nut-Free:** Use an additional ¼ cup gluten-free measure-for-measure flour in place of the almond flour.

**Rest Time:** A 30-minute rest helps the flavor to develop and the gluten-free flour to hydrate. Refrigerating the dough will yield even more flavorful cookies!

**Freeze Cookie Dough:** You can freeze cookie dough balls and store them in a resealable bag. Simply add 1-2 minutes onto the bake time.
