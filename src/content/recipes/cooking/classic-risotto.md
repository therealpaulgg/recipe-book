ingredients:
- ½ cup minced sweet onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 quart vegetable broth or chicken broth
- Kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cups dry white arborio rice
- 1 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay
- 1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish
- Zest from ½ lemon
- 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme (optional but recommended)
- Freshly ground black pepper

directions:
- Prepare the onion and garlic. 
- Combine the broth, 4 cups water, and 1 tsp kosher salt in a saucepan. Bring to a low simmer, then reduce heat to low.
- In a large skillet, melt the butter with olive oil over medium heat. 
- Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes until tender. 
- Add the garlic and rice, and cook for 2 minutes until the rice turns light brown, stirring occasionally.
- Stir in the wine and cook until fully absorbed, stirring occasionally.
- Add two ladles of hot broth to the risotto, stirring occasionally until the liquid is absorbed. 
- Continue adding two ladles of broth at a time, stirring occasionally until each addition is absorbed, for about 12 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a steady simmer.
- Taste the rice; when it is al dente, reduce the heat to low.
- Add two more ladles of broth, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper to the risotto. Stir vigorously for 1-2 minutes until thick and creamy.
- Add the lemon zest, thyme, and more salt if needed. Stir to combine.
- Serve the risotto with additional Parmesan cheese on top.
- Store any leftovers refrigerated for up to 3 days. To reheat, use the stovetop and add extra broth, Parmesan, and salt to taste.
