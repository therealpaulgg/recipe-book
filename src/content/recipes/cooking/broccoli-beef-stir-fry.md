rating: 8

ingredients:
- 1 1/4 lbs steak thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon peanut oil divided use
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
- 3-4 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 cup oyster sauce
- 1/2 cup beef broth or water
- 2 teaspoon sugar
- 4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
- 2 teaspoon soy sauce
- 2-3 teaspoons cornstarch
- salt and pepper to taste

directions:
- Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the broccoli and cook for approximately 4 minutes or until tender.
- Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and cook for 30 seconds more.
- Remove the broccoli from the pan; place on a plate and cover.
- Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel and turn the heat to high. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil.
- Season the steak pieces with salt and pepper and add them to the pan in a single layer - you may need to do this step in batches. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until browned and cooked through.
- Add the broccoli mixture back to the pan and cook for 2 more minutes or until warmed through.
- In a bowl whisk together the oyster sauce, beef broth, sugar, sesame oil and soy sauce. In a small bowl mix the cornstarch with a tablespoon of cold water.
- Pour the oyster sauce mixture over the beef and vegetables; cook for 30 seconds. Add the cornstarch and bring to a boil; cook for 1 more minute or until sauce has just started to thicken.
- Serve immediately, with rice if desired.

notes: I initially had the sauce halved. but i doubled it because it was really not enough.
