servings: 6

ingredients:
- Cooking spray
- 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
- Salt, to taste
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1-inch knob of ginger
- 1 teaspoon (2g) ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon (3g) ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon (1g) cayenne powder
- ½ cup (120ml) chicken stock
- 1 15-ounce can (425g) crushed tomatoes
- Water
- 1 cup (240ml) half & half
- 6 cups cooked basmati rice

components:
- Tikka Masala Marinade

directions:
- Mince garlic and ginger.
- Heat a high-sided sauté pan to medium-high and grease with cooking spray. Once the pan is hot, add all the chicken cubes and sear, without touching, for 2 minutes or until golden brown on the first side. Flip each piece and sear for 1 more minute. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
- Lower the heat to medium and add the onion, season lightly with salt, and sauté until softened. Stir in the garlic and ginger and sauté for 3 minutes.
- Add the spices and stir to combine with the onions. Sauté for 30 seconds or until fragrant.
- Stir in the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, and a splash of water. Season lightly with salt to taste. Increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Once it starts to boil, add the mixture to a blender and blend on high until it is as smooth as possible.
- Return the blended mixture to the pan and add a splash of water to thin the sauce out slightly. Reduce heat to low and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the chicken back to the pan and let simmer for 10 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through and the sauce has reduced.
- Add half and half, stir, and simmer for 3 more minutes.
- Season to taste with salt and serve immediately with 1 cup of rice per plate. Garnish with cilantro leaves.
