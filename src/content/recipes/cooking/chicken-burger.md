directions:
- Mix spices and ground chicken together by folding repeatedly.
- Form into patties (1/3lb each). Patties should not be that thin, a little thick.
- Add olive oil to a pan and heat to medium high.
- Place the patties on the pan and let sear for 2-3 minutes.
- Once seared, flip, pushing down slightly to flatten the patty (not too flat, just enough to make full contact with the pan) and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
- Cook until internal temperature reaches close to 165F.
- Add cheese to the patties and cook until melted (covering helps)
- Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.

Calories may be more/less depending on the bun you choose.

I went for 1/3lb patties for the extra protein & fullness, 1/4 are just too small most of the time.
