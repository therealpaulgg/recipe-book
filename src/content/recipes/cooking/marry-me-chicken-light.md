title: Marry Me Chicken (Light Version)
category: cooking
tags: [chicken, italian, light, low-calorie]
servings: 4

ingredients:
- 3 large chicken breasts boneless and skinless
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- 1 cup chicken stock (low-sodium)
- ½ cup half and half
- ¼ cup Greek yogurt (0% fat)
- ¼ cup parmesan cheese grated
- 1 teaspoon chili flakes
- ¼ teaspoon oregano
- ¼ teaspoon thyme
- ⅓ cup sundried tomatoes chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh basil leaves
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes halved
- 1 cup baby spinach

directions:
- Season chicken with salt and pepper, then lightly dredge in flour and shake off any excess.
- In a large skillet, heat olive oil and melt the butter on medium heat. Swirl pan to coat evenly.
- Brown the chicken (do not overcrowd and work in batches if needed) for 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through.
- Transfer chicken onto a plate, cover, and set aside.
- Saute the garlic for a minute or until it's fragrant. Add the chicken stock, and deglaze the pan scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
- Adjust the heat to medium-low, and add the half and half to the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes.
- In a small bowl, whisk the Greek yogurt until smooth, then gradually add about 2 tablespoons of the warm sauce to the yogurt to temper it. Add the yogurt mixture back to the skillet along with the parmesan cheese.
- Season with chili flakes, thyme, and oregano.
- Add salt and pepper to taste, then stir in the sundried tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, and spinach. Let cook for 1-2 minutes until spinach begins to wilt.
- Return the chicken to the pan and let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few more minutes.
- Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves and serve warm over whole grain pasta or cauliflower rice for an even lighter option.
