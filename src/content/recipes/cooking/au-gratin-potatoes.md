- 3.5 lbs gold potatoes

  servings: 2
- 1.25 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup shredded Parmigiano Reggiano cheese

components:
- Cheese Sauce

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart casserole dish.
- Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; season with salt and pepper.
- Layer onion slices over top, then top with remaining potatoes. Season again with salt and pepper.
- Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook, whisking constantly until raw flour flavor has cooked off, about 1 minute.
- Gradually add milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking well after each addition to incorporate and avoid lumps.
- Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.
- Stir in cheese all at once; continue stirring until melted, 30 to 60 seconds.
- Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.
- Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is bubbly, about 1 hour and 15 minutes (depending on potato slice thickness).
- Remove foil and broil in the oven for 5 minutes to get the cheese crispy on top.
