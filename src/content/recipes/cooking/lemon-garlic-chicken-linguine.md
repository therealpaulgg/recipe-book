This was originally a shrimp recipe but then I learned that there is excessive sodium in here. So replaced w/ chicken instead.

Absolutely love the flavor in this one. It was missing something so adding dried tomatoes helped a bit.

Made with chicken, realized I did not nearly have enough pasta (oof). So I doubled it and increased the servings. Make it 4 or even 5 servings and you'll still get 50g+ of protein.
